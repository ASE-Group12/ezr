If you understand your code, you can rewrite it  in less code. 
You know what is essential and what is superfluous.
And you know
how to do multiple tasks, just by calling your code a slightly different way.

This site presents EZR, a  Python AI tool kit  that implements numerous AI tasks, in a tiny codebase
(less than 1000 lines).
It supports  optimization, prediction, classification, planning, monitoring, explanation, anomaly detection,
semi-supervised learning, active learning, sequential model optimization, multi-objective reasoning,
privacy, data sharing,  and everything else discussed below. Sound complex, right? Well, as we shall see,
many of these AI tasks shre a common base which means one we get one of them going, the rest mostly fall into place.

Not only that, but all the code can be used as teaching examples for good practices in software engineering
like encapsulation, polymorphism, DRY (don't repeat yourself), test-driven development, patterns, domain-specific languages,
declarative programming, functional programming, object-oriented programming (and everything else discussed below).

Lastly, this code is usual as a sample of some of the more powerful features of Python like list comprehensions,
regular expressions, etc. etc.

- 45 Pythons tips and tricks;
- 34 SE tips and tricks;
- 22 AI tips and tricks.

So have a read, see what you think. I use this code for teaching graduate AI and SE, as well as training my Ph.D. students
on how to AI easier (usually for some SE applications). You could use this code for all manner of things
such as quickly delivering an initial prototype. Or, indeed, or working out that all you need is that prototype, since it does most of what you need.

Share and enjoy. And if I missed any tips and tricks, then I'd love to hear about it. Drop me a line!
